        %br
        %br
        While entry to the café is free, we restrict bookings to the cat rooms to 15 per hour. This is done to ensure the happiness and welfare of our brave catstronauts.

        %b How much does it cost to visit the cats? 
        %br
        %br
        $20 will buy you an hour with the cats, in addition to a complimentary cat-shaped cookie and a coffee/tea/hot chocolate. 
      %p
        %b Do I need to pay to enter the café?
        %br
        %br
        Not at all! While patrons do need to pay a fee to enter the cat room, anyone can enter the café free of charge and order a meal or a catpuccino.
      %p
        %b Can I still enter the cat room if I don’t have a booking?
        %br
        %br
        While entry to the cat room will be contingent on availability of spaces, we do welcome guests to enter without a booking. Simply keep in mind that entry to the cat room commences on the hour, and that weekend bookings disappear quickly!
      %p
        %b Am I allowed to take photos with or of the cats?
        %br
        %br
        Of course! Feel free to snap away (as well as share and hashtag to your heart’s content :P) however, please be mindful not to use flash as this may distress the cats. 
      %p
        %b Can I pick the cats up up?
        %br
        %br
        As each catstronaut has different preferences when it comes to hooman interaction, we advise all of our guests to follow the cat handler’s instructions when interacting with our resident felines. Some love to be picked up and cuddled, some like to be admired from a distance, and some like to be gently stroked behind the years. As the welfare of the cats is our priority, we ask that all guests respect the wishes of our intrepid space felines, and give them room when they so require it.
      %p
        %b How many cats do you have?
        %br
        %br
        We have a total of 19 cats in the café. 15 are kept in the primary cat room, while another four are kept in a dedicated “Space Cat R&R” room to allow the kitties periods of controlled hooman interaction. We also maintain a separate “hooman-free” room for the cats that need a break from interaction with our guests, so please note that the number of available cats will be contingent upon their wellbeing and their willingness to socialise.  
      %p
        %b Where did you find the cats? 
        %br
        %br
        In addition to being galaxy-roaming catstronauts, all of our cats are rescues who have been fostered from the World League from Protection of Animals. WLPA has worked closely with Catmosphere to select sociable cats that are comfortable interacting with hoomans, thereby ensuring all of our resident felines enjoy (or at least tolerate) the presence of homo sapien guests. 
      %p
        %b Is there an ideal time of day to visit the cats?
        %br
        %br
        Cats tend to sleep for around 18 hours a day, and we have observed that many of our resident catstronauts favour the afternoon as their ideal period for a cat nap. If you (like us!) find the presence of sleeping cats to be therapeutic, the early afternoon is a supurrb time to visit. If, however, you prefer your space cats when they’re at their zaniest, we recommend booking a session for either the morning or evening.

        %b What kind of precautions will you be taking to maintain proper hygiene in Catmosphere Sydney? 
        %br
        %br
        At Catmosphere Sydney, the rigorous maintenance of health and hygiene standards is of the utmost importance – after all, no one wants to take a sip of their latte and cough up a fur ball. For this reason, Catmosphere Sydney keeps the cats and the café in two separate areas. In accordance with Sydney City Council regulations, these areas are separated by an airlock (thereby negating the possibility of either cats or cat fur infiltrating the café area), and guests will be required wash and sanitise their hands upon both entry and exit from the cat area. 
      %p
        %b Will the cats be allowed periods of rest during the day? 
        %br
        %br
        Absolutely! The Catmosphere Sydney cat room features a myriad of shelves, nooks, and cat condos that allow the catstronauts to remove themselves from the environment and nap whenever they wish. We also have a dedicated cat handler who constantly monitors the catstronauts and removes any who look as if they need a respite from all the hooman admiration. 
        Catmosphere Sydney has now also closed off certain sessions during the afternoon to ensure our catstronauts can enjoy periods of uninterrupted rest before embarking on their evening hijinks.

        %b How will the wellbeing of cats and guests be maintained in Catmosphere Sydney? 
        %br
        %br
        As mentioned above, Catmosphere Sydney employs a dedicated cat handler to oversee the wellbeing of both the cats and the guests. It will be the responsibility of the handler to ensure all guests treat the cats respectfully, to remove any cats who need a break, and generally ensure that all felines and humans are enjoying themselves.

        %b Will guests be able to bring their own cats? 
        %br
        %br
        As much as we would love to allow guests to bring their own cats for a play date with ours, health and safety regulations prohibit us from hosting any external pets. 
      %p
        %b Will guests be able to adopt the Catmosphere cats? 
        %br
        %br
        As we want to create a stable, familial community for the cats we adopt, we have decided against adopting out the Catmosphere Sydney cats to customers, as the constant revolving door of cats would foster a transient environment for the catstronauts in our care. However, it is our goal for Catmosphere Sydney to connect rescue cats in need with loving homes. To this end, we will be working with the World League for Protection of Animals and Inner City Strays to adopt out stray and rescue cats via Catmosphere Sydney. We achieve this by showcasing cats currently available for adoption via screens in our cafe, thereby enabling and encouraging our guests to bring a feline into their family if they are able to do so.
