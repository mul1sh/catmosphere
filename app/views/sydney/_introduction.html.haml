          From July 25th, Sydney's aspiring astronauts and cat-lovers need look no further than their own city for a place to unite their passions. Catmosphere is a tribute and a home to brave astro-cats returning to Earth with many a tale of outer space adventures in galaxies far far away. Join us for a coffee, a meal, or maybe a nice cool drink for the purr-fect escape from the daily grind and a chance to play with our furry friends as they enjoy gravity and observe us humans in our natural habitats.
