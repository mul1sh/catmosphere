      %p The Chinko Project sustainably manages a nature reserve in the heart of Africa—one of the last pristine mosaics of wooded savannah and tropical lowland rainforest deep within the Central African Republic (CAR). This project goes beyond conservation, it represents hope for stability and governance in one of the poorest regions on earth with an endless history of conflict, corruption, depletion of natural resource and military conflict.
      %p Because of such consequences, Central African people are forced to leave their homelands and adapt their lifestyles - a struggle, that in tandem with a present lack of education and rampant poverty, results in the rapid depletion of its natural resources. One of the many sombering stories of the region concern the last remaining elephants of the region, which are constantly being hunted for their ivory. Other common realities include the illegal shooting of other animals for bush meat or their exotic pelts as well as significant amount of savannah and rainforst lumber being cut down for export.
      %p We are passionate about Africa – for both its wildlife and people—and believe there is a way for both to coexist. The Chinko Project, as a governance body, supports local communities, protects the ecosystem, and maintains economic value through tourism - providing the key to a sustainable future for this thriving ecosystem.
      %p As a young Non-Profit Organisation working in a challenging environment, support is essential. We are very thankful by all financial and in-kind support by organisations (namely the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the African Parks Network, ANPN CAR, BASEhabitat, the University of Fribourg, Panthera, the Foundation for Wildlife Ecology Basel and Central African Wildlife Adventures) and by the many private persons supporting us right from the beginning.. Join in and support us through a small <a href="#donations">donation</a>; learn more about the area, it's wildlife, and the Central African people; follow us on Twitter, and feel free contact us.
