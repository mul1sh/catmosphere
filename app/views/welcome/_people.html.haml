          The Central African people — mostly smallholder farmers living in the villages
          sedentary to the Chinko nature reserve, and transhumant herdsmen trespassing with
          their livestock to access the meat markets in Bangui — are among the poorest on
          the continent.
        %p
          The Chinko Project offers an income, and stability to many of these families, and
          through the support of schooling programs gives the children a chance not
          possible until now.
