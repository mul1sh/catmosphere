        %p The Chinko Project Area's ecosystem is today facing two major pressures:
        %ol.threats
          %li
            %p
              %b Armed Sudanese Herdsmen
              with cattle herds of more than 1,000 each come into the area for grazing -
              depleting the habitat in the long term and putting immediate stress on the
              wildlife.
            %p
              Some actively try to clean the area off predators that would put
              their livestock in danger, while others have discovered the economic benefit
              of poaching and drying bush meat to trade on Sudanese markets.
          %li
            %p
              %b Ivory poachers
              usually comprised of Sudanese professionals and rebel groups, threatening
              the small herd of surviving forest elephants in the region.

        %p To reduce that pressure, we take action:
        %ol.actions
          %li
            %p
              %b Conduct Research
              to better understand the complexities and trade chains underlying bush meat
              and ivory trade from Chinko to Sudan.

          %li
            %p
              %b Provide Incentives
              for the herdsmen to pass through a designated livestock corridor as quickly
              as possible.
          %li
            %p
              %b Inform
              herdsmen about possibilities of protecting their livestock against
              predators.
          %li
            %p
              %b Build capacity
              by training and deploying Central African park rangers, and supporting local
              school programs to make people better understand the value of wildlife.
          %li
            %p
              %b Monitor & Patrol
              the area with advanced surveillance strategies.
          %li
            %p
              %b Detect & disarm
              poaching infringers inside the nature reserve and hand them over to the next
              state authority.
